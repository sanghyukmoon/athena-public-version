Athena++ radiation MHD code

open BC self-gravity module
======

* Includes self-gravity with vacuum (open) boundary condition via James algorithm **(Moon, Kim, & Ostriker, in prep.)**
* Supports Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates.
* Currently, gravitational acceleration is added simply as a source term, rather than flux using gravitational tensor.
